As the title says, **"lishogi was made by the lichess team"** is a comment that has appeared here and there.

First let me respond clearly: **NO**. 

**"Well, but the site design is exactly the same,"** some of you might be thinking, so let me explain how lishogi operates as far as I am confident. But I don't claim to fully understand everything, so if there are any mistakes please point them out to me.

## lichess is open-source

As lichess is open-source, the code does not belong to any single person, and can be used by anybody.

[Tweet by Ben Johnson, host of the Perpetual Chess Podcast, sharing a clip of episode 221 where lichess admin Chris Callahan explains the ethos of lichess regarding sharing the code for its website](https://twitter.com/Bennyficial1/status/1380588752532348939)

**Rewriting the lichess code for their own uses are lishogi and lidraughts (for draughts).**

They are spiritual clones of lichess, but **these are created and operated by other groups of people**. Of course, some people are involved in more than one of these projects.

## How are the operations organised?

There are the **developers** who write the actual code, the **moderators** who act as spokespeople or use their powers to punish rulebreakers, the **Patrons** who donate money in support, those **supporters** who have no official role but contribute through bug reports or in other ways, and the **users** of the site.

There is also strong cooperation with **streamers** and **coaches** which may further develop in the future.

<br/>

**"There are only people from overseas, do they really understand shogi?"** is a doubt that is commonly raised. But **yes, they really do get it.**

This is **the result of Hidetchi-shi and Karolina Ladies' Professional's huge efforts.** One can sense that **of the people currently supporting lishogi, many come from the overseas community started by those two.**

From history to the latest news, they understand it at least as well as the average shogi fan, so there is no reason to be concerned. However, if there is something they can't know about from overseas, there are Japanese supporters who will be willing to share this information.

## Summary

lishogi is the spiritual ally of lichess, but the people running it are mostly different.
