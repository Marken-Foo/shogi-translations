# lishogi latest updates (6th April) #

*(Original post by ch_suginami-san: https://note.com/ch_suginami/n/n0993291fac12)*

Long time no see. I've been busy with life, and haven't had much time for my own activities, but I'm doing fine.

Now since lishogi has had various updates, here's another introduction to them. Those who follow me on Twitter would already know much of this, but let's leave another record of it here. There're also some bonuses at the end.


## Event: Bougyoku tournament ##

lishogi's first official shogi event was an April Fool's event, which ran smoothly. To get the winner's trophy, one had to move one's own king to the 4th rank by the 30th move, but otherwise play normally in an arena format. The time control for each game was 5 minutes sudden death, and the arena duration was 1 hour, a short event.

lishogi's management seems to have been surprised by the large number of participants. This shows just how high the expectations were from lishogi users. I wasn't sure if I could make it for the event, so ended up just observing.

There were also those who livestreamed the tournament itself. Many Vtubers were playing, so there were probably many people who didn't hear about the event directly, but rather found out through watching a stream and joining halfway.

In any case, thanks should go to the lishogi staff for running this tournament, and we as users look forward to future (official) tournaments.

## Try rule correction ##

I had previusly written about the incorrect implementation of the try rule due to documentation issues, but this has now been rectified. The condition of "double entering kings" has been removed, and it is now possible to aim at directly entering the opponent's camp. Now that there are no extraneous considerations such as the speed of the opponent's entering king to worry about, this is a big change for the players.

And in an official announcement, it was announced that the impasse declaration method is planned to be included, so bear in mind that there will still be future changes regarding jishogi. That said, this is undeniably a step forward.

## Tactics implemented!!! ##

The OG lichess has recently seen a burst of activity after adding "Puzzle Storm", and lishogi has done much the same. It's been a long time coming, but the long-awaited Puzzles feature has finally been implemented.

Because it's such a big piece of news I'll say it again.

**Puzzles have been implemented!!!**

This functionality lets more people attack tactics problems, and makes it easier for them to improve. That said, Puzzles is still in the early stages of implementation, with some puzzles contributed by a number of people, and a few others being automatically generated. It still feels like a prototype and is moving forward by trial and error, but it is nonetheless a huge step forward to have gotten it working in the first place. This is something I want to keep supporting.

## Bonus 1 ##

Right now Vtubers are running a big shogi event, the [*V Meijin Tournament*](https://sites.google.com/view/v-meijin). The live commentary in Japanese, which may be a bit of a high barrier for overseas viewers, but there are participants across a wide range of skill levels and intense battles everywhere, so if possible please do take a look.

If you need help, I will spare no effort in promoting shogi, so just say the word!

## Bonus 2 ##

Puzzles have been implemented, but it is still early days and there may still be some shortcomings and areas for improvement. To help tide over this period, I'm using the Study feature to create next-move problems.

But this time I'm going to just put out the problems without answers (since explanations do take a lot of time and effort to make after all). Of course I have my own reasons, and I really would like to provide explanations to the problems, but I simply don't have the time. I'd like to hear everyone's opinions on this too.

The thinking behind just providing the problems was also to provide a platform for discussion. To that end I'd like to play many games at lishogi and leave many problems of good quality. I hope that having next-move problems and thinking about them together -- including overseas players -- will help everyone improve.

Although I'm repeating myself here, while the Puzzles feature is being worked on, having more games played on lishogi will also rapidly increase its quality too. Of course, all the lishogi staff are working hard behind the scenes. That's why I'd like to ask this question as a matter of cooperation to improve shogi as a whole. Puzzles are not taken from only my own games, but simply putting forth the problems also gives me satisfaction.

So I hope to be able to help with Puzzles at the backend for the long-term. While it's nice to have lots of puzzles generated automatically, sometimes it leaves the opinion of a human to be desired. I'd be happy to fill in that role when the need arises. Of course, I would like to respond to comments as far as possible, so I would like for your support in this.
