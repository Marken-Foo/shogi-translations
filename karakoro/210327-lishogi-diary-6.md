Just a diary

As the thumbnail shows, I recently organised an arena tournament and seven other people participated. Arena tournaments are popular everywhere; there was an arena on lidraughts with 80 participants, despite having not more than 350 concurrently online users. The more people there are, the more fun the arenas are. I believe the day will come when there are lishogi arenas where the number of participants is in the three digits.

<br/>

What concerns me now is whether puzzles can be successfully generated. Shogi Quest and Shogi Wars each have something similar, but the calculation depth is reduced as though they were not pursuing soundness in their puzzles, and it leaves something to be desired. In fact, the lishogi Puzzles release has been delayed by more than a month. But it's not my place to stick my nose into technical areas, so I can only wait. There is talk that manual verification of puzzles might be needed, so if it comes to that I want to help unreservedly.

<br/>

It's not all bad news. I found an interesting post.

[Byo-yomi (countdown) game clock 揃 Issue #84 66 揃 ornicar/lila](https://github.com/ornicar/lila/issues/8466)

It's a suggestion to incorporate lishogi's byoyomi into lichess. The post is in favour of the byoyomi system. I thought that it was just lishogi unilaterally using code from lichess, but that's not the case. The li- spirit is shared between the li-projects.

<br/>

Looking at the lichess GitHub, you may be overwhelmed by the sheer number of issues with activity, but if you look closely, many are just self-righteous feature proposals, so it's not as intimidating as it looks. However, because there are just so few developers, I feel that I should limit myself to reporting serious bugs and lecturing people for violating a cultural taboo. My own opinion is that shogi is "just a game", so unless you really touch upon a horrible taboo you're free to do what you will.

<br/>

This is really inconsequential, but I had thought I was one of the oldest lishogi users. Looking at the lishogi blog posts however, it seems to have existed from September last year (2020). I took notice around November 15. Totally not the oldest. How embarrassing.

So it's been four months since then. Now it's common to see over 150 online users. (Probably) There has been no deliberate advertising, and those who gathered tend to be passionate supporters, so this level of activity is rather fine. Even if it were to increase above this level, there are already not enough devs and many bugs, so it can't be helped. It would destroy the devs' motivation if they had to deal with the chatter from many users reporting the same bug all day.

<br/>

Critical bugs have been dealt with, core features have been implemented, and the user count has already comfortably surpassed the two-digit range, so I don't know when lishogi is going to remove the "beta" from their logo. It is important to continue supporting the project with patience and respect.
