# Hopes for lishogi #

*(Original post by karakoro-san: https://note.com/karakorororo/n/n6413990e80c1)*

Every day, kind volunteers are working to develop lishogi.

This time I will raise several features that I am particularly looking forward to as lishogi continues to grow.

## A complete tournament system ##

The [picture](https://assets.st-note.com/production/uploads/images/39523143/picture_pc_a1a21a1e79deecf68b1563a5b6e58457.png) shows the lichess tournament schedule. lichess is the more established platform which lishogi is based on and is very similar to. Even when there is no particular event happening, there are this many tournaments going on.

lichess has at least 40,000 online users and 20,000 games ongoing at any given time. How much lishogi can grow is hard to estimate, but with even a tenth of the users, holding tournaments like this would be quite fun.

## Computer kifu analysis ##

Actually this is [already being introduced](https://assets.st-note.com/production/uploads/images/39523348/picture_pc_fb6892a34a2075c46fdb47bab6b8e3cf.png).

But the engine is weak, the notation style is that of chess, and there are bugs in the SFEN, so it leaves something to be desired.

At the moment, shogi sites are **divided into playing sites and analysis sites**, so bringing both aspects together in a single site would be a great boon. An exception to the norm would be Shogi W\*rs with its unusual paid model.

## Tactics trainer ##

The [picture](https://assets.st-note.com/production/uploads/images/39523740/picture_pc_ad742494f1249e2ffea32b05a8661c1f.png) shows the lichess tactics trainer.

The tactics trainer is **a set of "next move" puzzles extracted from positions in real games**.

The user's rating goes up and down according to whether they answer correctly or not. The puzzles' difficulty rating is also adjusted up or down according to the user's rating, so the difficulty levels are adaptive.

This is very interesting. **Endlessly getting puzzles suited for your level - it's irresistable.** It is currently unavailable, but is the functionality I am most looking forward to.

## Game database ##

Currently, there are doubts around the inability to freely use kifu.

[(Note.com post regarding the strict Ouza match kifu usage guidelines)](https://note.com/benli/n/n51137b4daf60)

I would like lishogi to create a sufficiently robust kifu database to make some waves.

## Summary ##

In chess, **it is the norm to be able to play free and unlimited games, to use game records freely, and to have a wealth of learning tools offering paid content.**

Although I know it is unfair to compare across different cultural backgrounds, I am still saddened to see the current state of affairs with shogi sites and apps.

I believe that **it would be good if lishogi, with a complete set of features, could foster a sense of healthy competition among the shogi sites and applications.**
