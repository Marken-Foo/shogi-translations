# Huge lishogi update! #

*(Original post by karakoro-san: https://note.com/karakorororo/n/nd0c2c2e4042c)*

Lishogi has been updated, and there are a fair number of new features and improvements.

Let's look at them one by one.

## Introducing click-to-drop-pieces ##

Previously, pieces in hand had to be dragged onto the board to be dropped, but now clicking works too.

This makes playing on smartphones much easier and is a huge deal.

## Streamer system ##

Once registered as a lishogi streamer, include the keyword "lishogi.org" in your stream title.

The stream will appear on the lishogi main page.

The above picture shows lichess, but it's the same on lishogi.

At the moment, those who have registered appear to be the usual suspects among overseas streamers.

## Added shogi videos ##

At the moment there are just five videos but in time this section will fill out.

## Summary ##

There are many other smaller changes but the main improvements are the three mentioned above.

I think enabling click-to-drop and the streamer system are particularly big steps forward.



It feels like just byoyomi remains to be added. It seems tricky to ensure it remains balanced with the current rating system and the existing increment time control, but I don't think it will take too long.

The blog has also been made available in Japanese, so it's becoming a site that Japanese people can appreciate more easily.

As a user, I want more people to join to the point where it's not difficult to get games quickly.

I look forward to the future growth of lishogi.
