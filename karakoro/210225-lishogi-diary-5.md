# lishogi diary 5 #

lishogi was mentioned on Twitter by lichess.

["Yay! Someone forked Lichess to create an open-source Shogi server :D Go check out lishogi.org"](https://twitter.com/lichess/status/1364566949716443138)

So I'll write something about lishogi for the first time in a while. There weren't any particularly big changes, it's more for my own interest in reading later.

<br/>

It seems that puzzles are taking a while to implement. However, this is probably unsurprising, or even expected, to those familiar with both shogi and chess. Instead it seems like they intend to bring in tsumeshogi puzzles, so I went about seeking direct permission from the composers, and got about 1000 problems. If these tsumeshogi puzzles become popular, I'd like to gather volunteers and do more on a larger scale. Probably there won't be enough volunteers though...

<br/>

Right now I think I'm somewhere between a supporter and a moderator. I don't have much power, but I can influence a few things. If lishogi grows I think a native Japanese moderator will be important, so I'd like to steadily work hard to be picked for that position. Well, even if becoming a moderator won't make me special.

<br/>

When lishogi was at the start of its ascent, I was impassioned and halfway frenzied by the thought that it would take over, but after 3 months I've calmed down. At least I don't think it will be one of the mainstream actors until the app is ready, and now that Shogi Quest implemented its tsume challenge it has possibly stolen lishogi's "puzzle" thunder. lichess is a strong backer, but 81Dojo only has about 100 international players. This is probably because of the weakness in English content. If so then we'd need to attract Japanese players after all, but it'll be hard without a significant amount of buzz. Nevertheless, I still like the polished UI and the "free forever" aspect. Also since it is not beholden to revenue, I believe that lishogi can still bring forth something that shogi culture has yet been unable to.

<br/>

The point where lishogi is likely to garner attention is when puzzles are implemented, and when the official release is made. In the end, I'm just an observer and not a developer or anything, but I'll still do what I can to help.
