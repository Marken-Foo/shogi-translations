# Support the new shogi site! #

*(Original post by karakoro-san: https://note.com/karakorororo/n/n2430ed35f363)*

**lishogi**, a shogi site launched about a month ago.

[(lishogi: The best free, adless Shogi server)](https://lishogi.org/)

**Open source content that everyone can contribute to**.

As can be seen from **lichess, which lishogi is modelled upon**, the returns are massive once the site is mature.

On top of this, **automatic generation of next-move problems from real games** and **rich shogi variants offerings** would be nice to look forward to.

Once the site matures, it will surpass existing shogi sites and apps across the board.

<br/>

That is the lishogi project. This time I'll explain simply **how to support it**.

Summary

## 1. Posting on social media ##

Not many people know of the lishogi project yet.

Even just posting on Twitter or playing a game on lishogi will be very effective.

Of course, tweeting about this post is fine too.

If you're a streamer, how about that high-impact 15-second-sudden-death time control.

## 2. Cultural adjustment ##

Japanese culture and shogi culture have often clashed with western values. I won't go into details, but this has already happened twice before.

Participating in Discord discussions and mediating between the cultures will help the project to run smoothly.

As a policy, most of us have the mindset of trying to avoid creating conflict.

## 3. Bug reports and feature suggestions ##

If there are bugs or features that you really want to see, you can make a post in the forums to let the developers know.

[(lishogi.org feedback forum)](https://lishogi.org/forum/lishogi-feedback)

But as far as possible try to make sure the bug or suggestion hasn't already been covered on GitHub.

[(lishogi GitHub issues page)](https://github.com/WandererXII/lishogi/issues)

You do need to be able to read English. There isn't a way around this.

<br/>

There are probably many people who can read English but not write in it (myself included). The forums are also in English, and this might put off some people.

For this, there is the Japanese channel in the lishogi Discord server.

If you post here, the important parts will be translated and communicated to the developers.

If you're not confident in your English, or if you're not sure it's already been covered, don't worry. Post here, for there are a number of Japanese speakers who know what's going on.

## 4. Become a Patron ##

The li- projects are supported by Patrons.

[(lishogi Patron information page)](https://lishogi.org/patron/)

Donations can be made through PayPal and Patreon.

There are **zero differences in functionality** for Patrons (such is the li- spirit), but you do get a cool wing.

## 5. Get involved in development ##

What is most lacking at the moment is **developers**.

[(lishogi GitHub page)](https://github.com/WandererXII/lishogi/)

I don't know any specifics here. If you know how to, please go ahead and contribute.

## Summary ##

I'm looking through everything related to lishogi, including the international community.

The desires are the same everywhere, but **the ones who do the work are the unpaid developers**.

There is little I can do myself and this is vexing, but I write this article to help spread the word and gather people, hopefully lessening some of the burden.

<br/>

This is not something that can be done quickly but a long-term project that could take years, but upon completion it would likely surpass existing shogi sites and apps in many respects.

Slowly but without pause, I want to do what I can to support this project.

Incidentally, the mysterious creature in the thumbnail is a mascot created by Will Maynard from the South Bay Shogi Club in California. It's a popular character in the overseas shogi community by the name of Bigsby.
