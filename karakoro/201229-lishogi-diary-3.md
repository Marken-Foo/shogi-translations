A roadmap towards the official full release of lishogi has been published on Discord.

Once everything has been carried out, lishogi will greatly surpass everything existing shogi sites have to offer in terms of features. I can only give a rough estimate since I'm not a developer, but going by the rate of progress until now, this would take half a year at best, or eight to nine months if they proceed normally. Maybe a year would be a good estimate.

Something like the current state of lidraughts could be the goal.

To be honest, because I'm disappointed with current shogi sites feature-wise, and because I can't abide the policies of \*\*\*\*\*\*, I am supporting lishogi. I feel that many Japanese on Discord are to some extent unhappy with the current state of the Japanese shogi world.

Just as the grass is greener on the other side, chessplayers are seeing the shogi world in a better light. A little while ago, a post on lichess about gender in chess started trending, and I was at a loss for words when I saw a comment like "I hope that the shogi world doesn't become like that". In the same way, regarding byoyomi and increment, from where I stand I think that increment is more rational, but the developers with a chess background think byoyomi is better. Of course, there are also those for whom the only bad thing about shogi is byoyomi. Leaving aside the pros and cons, my personal take is that because of the incompatibility of KIF and CSA with an increment time control, lishogi might be heading towards having only byoyomi.

The majority of lishogi supporters are from overseas, and as someone who didn't know of the existence of the overseas shogi community, the surprises have been coming one after another. They know more about the faraway shogi world than I had thought, even keeping up with the latest news. They tend to be good at languages, and many are skilled at a variety of games, not necessarily just shogi.

At the middle of it all is always Karolina-san. It is uncertain if this community would exist without Karolina-san. Hidetchi-shi's uploaded English videos are also remain very popular. There's probably nobody in the overseas shogi community who hasn't heard of these two people.

<br/>

Since I can't do dev work, I can only do simple miscellaneous tasks to help out. When new features are implemented I do bug checking; I help to verify rights and copyright issues; and I polish translations. As an individual user, I would want lishogi to be a platform where I can play a game against a player of about the same level. To this end, my role is to do what little I can to support and to advance the clock towards this goal.
