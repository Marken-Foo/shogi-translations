lishogi now regularly has around 40-70 people connected at any one time.

There's not much more I can do about that, and the one thing I'm worried about now is the amount of content for beginners. Of the 100,000 online lichess users, if we can just get one out of every hundred interested, that's still 1,000 more players we will get. At that point, whether there is enough content for beginners will likely have a high impact on the retention rate.

So, I made something like this.

[(*Tsume problems for beginners* - a lishogi study by karakoro)](https://lishogi.org/study/Ke2kN7y8)

A collection of tsumeshogi problems aimed at beginners. It's just that even though the problem sources are cited it's still in an awkward spot; moreover, playshogi.com already has a large quantity of tsume problems, so I'm starting to feel like there wasn't really a need to put this together.

[(PlayShogi.com)](http://playshogi.com/)

When I started using lichess, I liked the feeling that the one lichess site had everything available, but there isn't a need to aim for this right away on lishogi.

Besides, when tactic problem generation is successfully implemented, there won't be such a great need for tsumeshogi.

<br/>

So I started thinking what is most lacking in English shogi content. There are plenty of tsumeshogi. Same for content to help with learning the rules. Recent news updates are clearly lacking, but because of the substantial restrictions on kifu use, even I as a Japanese person have no idea, so not much can be done here.

<br/>

I remember when I was still studying chess. I started by reading and replaying games from books like *Logical Chess Move By Move*, with detailed and easy-to-read explanations. It's this that's lacking, isn't it. Pedagogical learning materials, where you pick up the basics just from reading.

<br/>

At this point three worries surfaced. "My shogi skill is insufficient," "Are there freely usable chess game records," and "My English skill is insufficient." For the question of shogi strength, please bear with me for now. For freely available kifu, at worst we can probably use kifu from Shogi Club 24. I had previously asked about kifu usage, and got permission with the conditions that it be for non-profit purposes, and that the user names be hidden. I'm grateful for this. I also got approval to use kifu from Shogi Vtuber tournaments. Something can come of this.

The biggest hurdle is my English skill, but I found something amazing.

[(ISM Magazine - Shogi Harbour)](http://www.shogi.pl/ism/)

It's a shogi magazine written in English with Karolina-san's involvement. At this point it has four issues in total, and several articles about shogi matches. If I collect shogi expressions from here and use DeepL Translate, I can just about write something. I would like to do simple introductions to strategies, and easy-to-understand game analysis.

[(*About Wrong-Diagonal Bishop (Sujichigai-Kaku)* - a lishogi study by HoneyMint)](https://lishogi.org/study/A7danIVZ)

The link is to a lishogi study about sujichigai-kaku by Hanimi-chan-san. If enough of this quality of material can be put into lishogi studies, English-speaking beginners' retention rate should definitely go up.
