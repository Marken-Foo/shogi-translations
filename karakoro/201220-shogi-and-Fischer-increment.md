# Shogi and Fischer increment #

*(Original post by karakoro-san: https://note.com/karakorororo/n/n59ecdc1261fb )*

The ubiquitous time setting in chess, Fischer increment.

In contrast, for shogi byoyomi is the norm, while increment time controls are not common.


That said, those who didn't know of Fischer increment were probably the majority a few years ago, but today there are probably **more who may never have tried it but still know about increment**.

Last time, the attitude used to be "**Fischer increment? That's not shogi,**" but today things are different.

For a concrete example, take this:

[*(note.com post "The appeal of increment shogi (AbemaTV Tournament)" by robomofu)*](https://note.com/robomofu/n/ne1d468d26d50)

abemaTV's shogi has without a doubt strengthened the awareness of Fischer increment.

Shogi Club 24 has had Fischer increment since a few years back. However, it's not that popular. This could be the influence of SC24 having a lot of serious players who want practice for real tournaments. But real-life tournaments don't use increment time controls, hence the SC24 option doesn't serve as good practice.

[*(tweet from Piyoshogi mentioning their many time control options, including increment)*](https://twitter.com/STUDIOKPONTA/status/1280349108998254592)

The popular app *Piyoshogi* has implemented increment time controls a few months ago.

[*(tweet from the creator of Shogi no Tomo about time controls they plan to add: 10-second byoyomi, 3+5 increment, and 10+0 sudden death)*](https://twitter.com/shogi_fan_masa/status/1340503103246794752)

The recently launched app *Shogi no Tomo* is also planning to introduce 3+5 increment games.


One can't simply say "most sites and apps don't have Fischer increment, ergo there is a need for increment!" However, unlike even the recent past, shogi users have created a fertile environment ready for the increment time control.

Byoyomi is mainstream and is still the most in demand, but who's to say that Fischer increment won't continue to gain more recognition from the ground?
