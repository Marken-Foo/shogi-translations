# lishogi is more fun when you customise it! #

*(Original post by karakoro-san: https://note.com/karakorororo/n/n304912c0fd7f)*

With the **implementation of byoyomi and the increase in registered streamers**, little by little the number of concurrent lishogi users is increasing.

Although one can go with the "simple is the best" pure white layout after registering, changing some settings here and there will improve the experience.

Thanks to the developers putting in their hard work on what seems like a daily basis, the default settings and content described in this post may differ from the actual site.

(Note) The display is different when logged in and when logged out.

When logged out: [(settings menu in top right when logged out, click on the gear icon)](https://assets.st-note.com/production/uploads/images/42274391/picture_pc_b613db1b82c436412650a81a8d199c49.png)

When logged in: [(settings menu in top right when logged in, click on username)](https://assets.st-note.com/production/uploads/images/42274347/picture_pc_40a6405742990adda78aabd32e9c7f5b.png)

There are a many settings that cannot be changed if not logged in, so definitely do try making an account to play on lishogi.


## Table of contents ##

- Sound effects
- Background
- Shogi board and piece design
- Notation -> "Japanese ▲７六歩"
- Zen mode -> "Yes"
- Click two squares to move
- Premoves -> "Yes"
- Summary

## Sound effects ##

The default sound is that of chess pieces.

Click the gear icon on the top right and select "Sound" -> "shogi1" or "shogi2".

This will change it to the familiar shogi piece sounds.

## Background ##

The default is a plain white theme.

Select "Background" -> "Dark" from the gear icon menu in the top right and the page will be in a calming black theme.

Personally I prefer this to the white theme.

Alternatively, selecting "Background" -> "Transparent" will give you the freedom to set your own background.

[(karakoro-san's custom background)](https://assets.st-note.com/production/uploads/images/42243858/picture_pc_465d3fb2e11d6b9290cc9f58104742a8.png)

「透明」 *(TN: "Transparent")* is not very clear, so I requested 「自由設定」 *(TN: "free setting", or "Custom")* as a better translation; whether it is accepted or not is up to the supporters.

## Shogi board and piece design ##

The default appearance is very simple. It isn't bad, and I actually quite like it.

[(default board and pieces)](https://assets.st-note.com/production/uploads/images/42244101/picture_pc_d4211175cdb3801ef082dd7d1869089d.png)

These can be changed in "Board theme" and "Piece set" from the gear menu at the top right.

I tried changing it to something very different. The above picture shows a **space-themed** board and an **original piece design**.

[(tweet by the creator of the custom piece set, @logygames)\*](https://twitter.com/logygames/status/1342000091687604224)

You can even play with **doubutsu shogi** pieces on a **hanging scroll** styled board.

My recommendation is this combination. It looks great and is very clear.

## Notation -> "Japanese ▲７六歩" ##

This is the usual notation style. *(TN note: this is the standard notation style for Japanese books and for the KIF file format.)*

## Zen mode -> "Yes" ##

[(Zen mode with custom theme, board and pieces)](https://assets.st-note.com/production/uploads/images/42244752/picture_pc_67b1d0fb9668e696be4f7ba4408b7695.png)

In Zen mode, unnecessary information like the opponent's username and rating are not displayed.

**The chat box is also hidden** so it becomes impossible to give greetings, but you have to accept this as the culture.

## Click two squares to move ##

[(lishogi user preferences, "How do you move pieces?" under game behaviour)](https://assets.st-note.com/production/uploads/images/42244873/picture_pc_3e88f0d917d8a93e8558c06692d05304.png)

It is by far easier to click than it is to drag.

In this way playing on smartphones is possible.

## Premoves -> "Yes" ##

[(lishogi user preferences, "Premoves" under game behaviour)](https://assets.st-note.com/production/uploads/images/42244934/picture_pc_2bf68408765e8c8738b3921c22589b5c.png)

Premove is a feature where you can enter the next move you intend to play while your it's still your opponent's turn.

This comes from chess. Although at first you may feel confused, once you get used to it it's incredibly convenient.

Absolutely recommended.

## Summary ##

I've summarised all the settings I recommend to use.

Especially with boards and pieces, there many options that I haven't seen before, so there's still plenty I'd like to try out.

As it's still in the early beta stage, there are many missing features and bugs, so if you find any please let us know.

You're always welcome on the Discord and in the forums.
